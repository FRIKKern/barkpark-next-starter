 * hop-cascade. We never touch the canvas; we only construct/destroy/update the
 * controller and forward node click/hover out as React callbacks.
 *
 * The script-load race is handled both ways:
 *   • script loads BEFORE mount → `onReady` fires, but the host is already in
 *     the DOM, so init runs immediately when the effect reads `window.BGR`.
 *   • script loads AFTER mount  → the effect polls `window.BarkparkGraphRenderer`
 *     until it appears (and `onReady`/`onLoad` flips a ref to stop early), then
 *     constructs.
 * Either way init runs exactly once per mount; the prop-change effect only
 * `update()`s an existing controller.
